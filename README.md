# Mini Screenshot

Mini Screenshot (formely Soslaio¹) lets you take screenshots and put them on a small floating window; the application also allows you to decrease the window opactiy when the mouse pointer is over it.

Best used with:
 - 'Always on Top' and/or 'Always on Visible Workspace'
 - A keyboard shortcut (make quick calls whenever you need it, as you do when taking normal screenshots)

_¹ "Soslaio" is a brazilian expression close to "sided eye", but meant more specifically when you look transversally, diagonally._
